## getting taxa info for lefse OTUs


# read in cons.taxnomy file

dataFull <- read.table(file="cDNAheadedFile.cons.taxonomy", header=T)
# this is a full dataframe of ALL my otus with their taxonomy information

dataCut <- read.table(file="Lefse-ids-cDNA.txt", header=T)
# this is a dataframe of just one column which contains a list of the top LEfSe OTUs
# that are in the df 'dataFull'

zz <- merge(dataCut, dataFull, by = "OTU")

## zz should be a df containing on the OTUS listed in dataCut, but now,
## those OTUS also have also the taxonomy from teh cons.taxonomy file. 


# can then read this out as a csv
write.csv(zz, file='cDNA-lefseTaxaInfo.csv')
